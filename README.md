### Project Evolution

This web application is a modern reimagining of a desktop application I previously built. The project was developed to master modern web technologies like Streamlit and to explore the practical applications of Artificial Intelligence in the civil engineering domain.

**To see the development journey from a command-line tool (v1.0) to a full-featured desktop application (v4.0), you can visit the predecessor repository here: [Survey-Measurement-Desktop](https://github.com/Dimas-SP08/Land-Measurement-code)**

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a seamless and intuitive user experience accessible from any web browser.
-   **Automated Survey Calculations**: Automatically computes essential metrics like elevation, height difference, and survey point status (RISE/FALL/FLAT), eliminating manual errors.
-   **ðŸ¤– Gemini AI Integration**:
    -   **Anomaly Detection**: Intelligently scans measurement data to identify potential errors or inconsistencies, ensuring higher data accuracy.
    -   **Automated Report Generation**: Generates comprehensive, professional-grade survey reports with a single click, summarizing findings and analyses.
-   **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Features interactive charts and plots for elevation profiles, height differences, and distance vs. elevation distributions, making complex data easy to understand.
-   **Professional Export Options**:
    -   Download AI-generated analysis reports in **Microsoft Word (.docx)** format.
    -   Export complete data tables and embedded graphs to **Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)**.
    -   Save individual plots and charts as high-quality **PNG** images.
